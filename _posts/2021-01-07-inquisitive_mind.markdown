Have you ever wondered how the internet works? How computers function and communicate with one another? I certainly have. The more I deep dive to find the answers the more I  become entangled in the web of the world that is computing (no pun intended). So many fascinating stories, industries, and fortunes built off engineering the latest and greatest software. There are many reasons why software is produced whether it is to fill a niche market need, to improve accessibility/ usability of products, or to challenge the norm. This is where my curious mind began to wonder about all the possibilities. This led me to conclude that I could channel my creative energy and pair it with my constant need to learn. This realization was the catalyst to my career change in this direction, and to beginning the journey of learning software engineering.
